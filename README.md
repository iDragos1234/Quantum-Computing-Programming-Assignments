# Quantum-Computing-Programming-Assignments
Programming Assignments for a Quantum Computing course that I am taking during the fall semester of 2023.

- The repository contains;
    -  3 jupyter notebooks corresponding to the 3 programming assignments that I have to complete as part of the course (already done by now),
    -  a lab report in pdf format for each assignment (still working on the 3rd one),
    -  a project and its report (still in progress).
    -  python files containing helper classes and functions.

- To run the notebooks, an IBM Quantum Platform account is needed. Simply copy IBMQ token assigned to one's account, as given in the IBM Quantum Platform, and paste it in the 2nd code box in each jupyter notebook.
