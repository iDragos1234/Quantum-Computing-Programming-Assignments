# Quantum-Computing-Programming-Assignments
Programming Assignments for a Quantum Computing course that I am taking during the fall semester of 2023.

- The repository contains;
    -  three jupyter notebooks corresponding to the 3 programming assignments that I have to complete as part of the course (already done by now),
    -  one jupyter notebook for the final project, an implementation of Shor's factorization algorithm
    -  python files containing helper classes and functions.

- To run the notebooks, an IBM Quantum Platform account is needed. Simply copy IBMQ token assigned to one's account, as given in the IBM Quantum Platform, and paste it in the 2nd code box in each jupyter notebook.

- To run the project notebook containing Shor's algorithm implementation, paste an IBMQ API token assigned to one's account into the 2nd box of the notebook, run all boxes, then change the number to factorize and/or the precision bits in the last box.
